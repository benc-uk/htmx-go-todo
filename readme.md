# HTMX with Go

A example of a simple HTMX app built using Go for learning purposes

Tech stack:
- Go
  - [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) (web framework and routing)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) (Dhur)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) (CSS)

Yes it's a todo app, of course it is, what did you expect?!
Currently there is no persistence or state store, everything lives in memory

## Repo

```
â”œâ”€â”€ server      Go code for HTTP server
â”œâ”€â”€ static      Static files, images CSS etc
â”œâ”€â”€ templates   HTML templates, views & fragments
â””â”€â”€ todo        Go code for the todo handler
```

## Development

Pre-reqs:

- A recent-ish version of Go (1.20+)
- A Linux environment with bash, make etc. WSL or MacOS is perfect.
